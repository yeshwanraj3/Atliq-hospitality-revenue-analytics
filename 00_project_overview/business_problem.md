 Business Problem

Atliq Hospitality management struggles to track:
- Revenue leakage due to cancellations
- Low occupancy in certain hotels and cities
- Performance differences across room types
- Seasonal booking trends

Without centralized analytics, decisions are reactive instead of data-driven.
