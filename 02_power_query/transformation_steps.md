Power Query Transformation Steps I Followed:

All data preparation in this project was performed using
Power Query inside Power BI.



 Data Cleaning
- Removed duplicate and null records
- Standardized column naming conventions
- Trimmed unnecessary whitespace
- Ensured data consistency across tables



 Data Preparation
- Corrected datatypes for dates, numeric fields, and keys
- Renamed columns for clarity and business readability
- Created calculated columns where required
- Ensured primary and foreign keys matched correctly



 Modeling Readiness
- Prepared fact and dimension tables for star schema
- Created aggregated fact table for performance optimization
- Validated relationships before model loading



Performance Considerations
- Removed unused columns
- Optimized query steps order
- Ensured minimal transformation complexity
